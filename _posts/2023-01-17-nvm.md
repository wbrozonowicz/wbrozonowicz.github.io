<!-- short introduction -->
## NVM!

NVM is node manager, install on linux by  (v0.40.1):

{% include code-header.html %}
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
```

Web page of project:
https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

After install -> restart terminal / editor

Check if running and what version:

{% include code-header.html %}
```
nvm --version
```

Install specific node version f.e. 14:

{% include code-header.html %}
```
nvm install 14
```

List all installed node versions:

{% include code-header.html %}
```
nvm ls
```

Show current used node version:

{% include code-header.html %}
```
nvm current
```

Change node to specific installed version:

{% include code-header.html %}
```
nvm use 14
```

On Linux We can add in project folder file ".nvrmc" and in file just type number of node version that We want to use in our project f.e. 18.

Now in project We can just use command:
{% include code-header.html %}
```
nvm use
```

... and nvm will find version in this file and switch to version 18 (if it is installed)

We can configure bash to do this automatically when enter folder, to do this We have to edit file .bashrc

Now in project We can just use command:
{% include code-header.html %}
```
sudo nano ~/.bashrc
```

and paste on the end of this file below code:

Now in project We can just use command:
{% include code-header.html %}
```
cdnvm() {
    command cd "$@" || return $?
    nvm_path="$(nvm_find_up .nvmrc | command tr -d '\n')"

    # If there are no .nvmrc file, use the default nvm version
    if [[ ! $nvm_path = *[^[:space:]]* ]]; then

        declare default_version
        default_version="$(nvm version default)"

        # If there is no default version, set it to `node`
        # This will use the latest version on your machine
        if [ $default_version = 'N/A' ]; then
            nvm alias default node
            default_version=$(nvm version default)
        fi

        # If the current version is not the default version, set it to use the default version
        if [ "$(nvm current)" != "${default_version}" ]; then
            nvm use default
        fi
    elif [[ -s "${nvm_path}/.nvmrc" && -r "${nvm_path}/.nvmrc" ]]; then
        declare nvm_version
        nvm_version=$(<"${nvm_path}"/.nvmrc)

        declare locally_resolved_nvm_version
        # `nvm ls` will check all locally-available versions
        # If there are multiple matching versions, take the latest one
        # Remove the `->` and `*` characters and spaces
        # `locally_resolved_nvm_version` will be `N/A` if no local versions are found
        locally_resolved_nvm_version=$(nvm ls --no-colors "${nvm_version}" | command tail -1 | command tr -d '\->*' | command tr -d '[:space:]')

        # If it is not already installed, install it
        # `nvm install` will implicitly use the newly-installed version
        if [ "${locally_resolved_nvm_version}" = 'N/A' ]; then
            nvm install "${nvm_version}";
        elif [ "$(nvm current)" != "${locally_resolved_nvm_version}" ]; then
            nvm use "${nvm_version}";
        fi
    fi
}

alias cd='cdnvm'
cdnvm "$PWD" || exit
```

Restart terminal / editor and it's done!!
