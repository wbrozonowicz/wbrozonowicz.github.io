<!-- short introduction -->
## Deployment of React App on Github Pages with React Router

On Hithub We can publish our app for free!
How to do this:
- install github pages in our project: 

"npm install --save gh-pages"


- add property homepage to package.json (get homepage from Your Github repo - has to be public, url will be in settings) f.e:\

 " "homepage": "https://yorghname.github.io/reponame/" "


- add scripts  in srcipts section : "predeploy" and "deploy" in package.json

    "predeploy" : "npm run build",
    "deploy: "gh-pages -d build",
    

- use command "npm run deploy" to publish Your app!


Notes:
- if app use router, We have to add basename path, so routes will be working correctly. To do this add:

"<Router basename={process.env.PUBLIC_URL}>"


That's all!
