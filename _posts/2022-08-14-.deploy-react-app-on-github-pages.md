<!-- short introduction -->
## Deployment of React App on Github Pages with React Router

On Hithub We can publish our app for free!
How to do this:
- install gitgub pages in our project: 

npm install --save gh-pages


- add property homepage to package.json (get homepage from Your Github repo - has to be public, url will be in settings) f.e:\

{
  "homepage": "https://yorghname.github.io/reponame/",
  "name": "project",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  ...


- add scripts "predeploy" and "deploy" in package.json

  "scripts": {
    "predeploy" : "npm run build",
    "deploy: "gh-pages -d build",
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  },


- use command "npm run deploy" to publish Your app!

- 

Notes:
- if app use router, We have to add basename path, so routes will be working correctly. To do this add:
```js
<Router basename={process.env.PUBLIC_URL}>
```

That's all!
